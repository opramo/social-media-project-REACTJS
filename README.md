I would like to say thank you to my Mentor https://github.com/masdefry and some of my colleagues from Purwadhika Digital School, my girlfriend and also both of my parents. Without them, It would be more difficult to finish this project.
This project took approximately 7 weeks to be completed. This is my first ever project, and I hope this will be one from many other projects that i will build in the future. Thank you!
